### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ Fond of challenges and solution finding. 

  *Currently focused on revenue generation through the creation of Machine Learning solutions.*

   I have over 4+ years of experience in data analysis and planning. I have worked on translating business needs into data, creating visualization layers, data governance, providing self-service access, and experimentation through A/B tests. 
   I hold a degree in Business Administration and am currently pursuing an MBA in Data Science.
   
   My main expertise is transforming business needs into effective Machine Learning solutions, increasing revenue, and reducing costs.
